<h3> Overview </h3>

This codebook is for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' which uses the ['Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset'](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

The dataset has a training and test dataset for the activities performed.
