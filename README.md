This repo is for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' which uses the ['Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset'](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

To perform analysis, the datasets are obtained from the above link and placed in the working directory in R.
The datastes to be obtained are:

activity_labels.txt <br/>
features.txt <br/>
X_test.txt<br/>
y_test.txt<br/>
X_train.txt<br/>
Y_train.txt<br/>
subject_test.txt<br/>
subject_train.txt<br/>

The R script used for analysis is [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/gowthe/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/run_analysis.R)

The output is exported as a table which can be read back to R using read.table()

For more information, please have a look at the codebook
